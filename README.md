# Autonomous Precision Farming with Reinforcement Learning

An autonomous farming drone system using reinforcement learning to optimize crop treatment and disease management in a 15×15 grid environment.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project implements four different RL algorithms to train an autonomous farming drone that treats diseased crops while managing battery life and operational efficiency. The agent navigates a farm environment, applies treatments to diseased crops, and recharges at designated stations.

## 🏆 Algorithm Performance Rankings

Based on 200 episodes of training:

| Rank | Algorithm | Success Rate | Average Reward | Parameters | Stability |
|------|-----------|--------------|----------------|------------|-----------|
| 🥇 | **PPO** | **64.5%** | -24.36 | 38,343 | Most Stable |
| 🥈 | **DQN** | **55.0%** | -24.69 | 19,334 | Stable |
| 🥉 | **REINFORCE** | **44.5%** | -28.86 | 38,343 | Moderate |
| 4th | **Actor-Critic** | **10.0%** | -22.99 | 19,399 | Unstable |

**Key Findings:**
- **PPO** emerged as the superior method due to clipped objective preventing destructive policy updates
- **DQN** performed well with experience replay and target networks for stable Q-learning
- **REINFORCE** showed promise but suffered from high variance typical of basic policy gradient methods
- **Actor-Critic** struggled with simultaneous actor-critic training without proper regularization
