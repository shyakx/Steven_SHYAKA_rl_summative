## üîç Key Findings

### 1. Performance Analysis
- **Actor-Critic** achieved the best test performance with -24.46 average reward
- **DQN** was the only algorithm to achieve meaningful success rate (30.0%)
- **REINFORCE** and **PPO** were fastest to train (~87 seconds average)
- All algorithms showed significant improvement over baseline performance

### 2. Training Characteristics
- **DQN**: Slower convergence but more stable, achieved actual task completion
- **REINFORCE**: Fast training but inconsistent evaluation performance
- **PPO**: Balanced approach with moderate performance across all metrics
- **Actor-Critic**: Best reward optimization but struggled with task completion

### 3. Algorithm Insights
- **Value-based (DQN)** showed better task completion despite lower rewards
- **Policy-based methods** optimized rewards but struggled with actual success
- **Parameter count** didn't directly correlate with performance
- **Training time** varied significantly (86s to 269s)

## üéØ Recommendations

1. **For Task Completion**: Use DQN for actual farming applications
2. **For Fast Prototyping**: Use PPO or REINFORCE for quick experiments
3. **For Reward Optimization**: Use Actor-Critic for fine-tuning reward functions
4. **For Production**: Consider ensemble approach combining DQN stability with Actor-Critic performance
