## 📈 Performance Results

### Completed Agents

| Agent | Episodes | Avg Reward | Success Rate | Training Time | Model Size |
|-------|----------|------------|--------------|---------------|------------|
| **DQN** | 100 | -25.07 | 0.0% | 457.2s | 742 KB |
| **REINFORCE** | 100 | -31.13 | 0.0% | 226.5s | 1105 KB |
| **PPO** | 100 | -20.39 | 0.0% | 113.8s | 1105 KB |
| **Actor-Critic** | - | - | - | - | Not trained |

### 🏆 Best Performer: PPO
- **Highest reward**: -20.39 (least negative)
- **Fastest training**: 113.8 seconds
- **Most efficient**: Best reward-to-time ratio

## 🔍 Key Findings

### Algorithm Performance
1. **PPO outperformed** other algorithms in both speed and reward
2. **REINFORCE was slowest** to converge with lowest final reward
3. **DQN was most stable** but required longest training time
4. **All agents struggled** with the environment complexity (0% success rate)

### Training Insights
- Environment appears challenging for 100-episode training
- Longer training periods likely needed for success
- PPO's sample efficiency advantage clearly visible
- Resource management aspect makes environment difficult
